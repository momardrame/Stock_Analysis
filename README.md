# Stock Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to conduct an analysis of a stock using VBA.

## Resources
- MS Excel

## Instructions
Using your Kickstarter data set Excel workbook, create two additional sheets. Name them "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" and "Outcomes Based on Goals."

### In the "Outcomes Based on Goals" sheet, do the following: 
#### Create 8 new columns with the following headings
##### Goal
-- Number Successful
-- Number Failed
-- Number Canceled
-- Total Projects
-- Percentage Successful
-- Percentage Failed
-- Percentage Canceled
### In the Goal column, create 12 new rows to sort each project. This will hold each goal range we're charting: 

Goal column with twelve rows of ranges
-- Use COUNTIFS()to count the number of successful, failed, and canceled projects within the newly defined ranges. (Filter the Kickstarter sheet to show only the Plays subcategory, otherwise, our scope includes all campaigns instead of the ones we are interested in.) Populate the appropriate columns.
-- Add each of the values in the Number Successful, Number Failed, and Number Canceled columns to populate the Total Projects column.
-- Use division to find the percentage of projects that fall into each category (percentage successful, percentage failed, and percentage canceled).
-- Create a line chart to visualize the relationship between the goal amount and the campaign’s chances of success, failure, or cancellation.

7. Save the line chart as a .png image, like the one below. (Note: This image is just an example)

### Line chart of outcomes based on Kickstarter goal
In the "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" sheet, do the following:
1. Create a pivot table that charts the outcome of each Kickstarter project based on the launch date.

2. Set the “Parent Category” filter to “theater” and save the chart as a .png image, like the one below.
